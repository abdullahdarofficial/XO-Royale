### XO Royale

XO Royale is a Tic Tac Toe game developed using the Flutter framework. This project was designed to showcase my skills in mobile app development with Dart and Flutter, emphasizing user interface design, interactivity, and smooth animations.

The game features a clean and intuitive interface, where players can easily navigate and engage in gameplay. I utilized Flutter's rich set of widgets to create a responsive and visually appealing layout. The game supports single-player and two-player modes, allowing players to challenge each other or play against a simple AI.

Key features include real-time updates of the game board, dynamic animations for moves and winning sequences, and a user-friendly design that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations. The state management is handled efficiently to ensure smooth transitions and immediate feedback for user actions. This involved using Flutter's state management solutions to maintain the game state and update the UI accordingly.

In developing XO Royale, I focused on implementing best practices in Flutter development, including effective use of widgets, managing state with Provider, and ensuring performance optimization. The project provided practical experience in handling user inputs, managing game logic, and creating a polished, interactive application.

Overall, XO Royale demonstrates my ability to build engaging and functional mobile applications using modern frameworks. The project not only highlights my technical skills but also reflects my commitment to creating high-quality software with a focus on user experience and design.
